There are several branches for different features. The current version of the project is on the **dev**-Branch. In order to switch branches, the command `git checkout dev` needs to be executed.

2. Installing dependencies: The dependencies of the project are contained within the **package.json** file. No changes are needed. `npm install` analyzes the **package.json** file and downloads the necessary dependencies needed for the frontend.

3. Starting the application: After downloading the dependencies, the angular project can be started on a dev server using `ng serve`. The default address to access the project is `http://localhost:4200/`.
